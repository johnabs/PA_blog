## Intellectual Property: Government Backed Monopolies For All

To those of you uninitiated into the world of intellectual property (IP), a quick explanation is in order. In essence, there are three types of IP: trademarks, copywritten works, and patents. Although there is technically a $4^\mathrm{th}$ classification, known as trade secrets, I am not particularly interested in them, as they are simply not revealed to the public. A primary example would be the Coca-Cola formula: it was refined over a long period of time, and it is kept closely guarded as to prevent anyone else from reproducing their product and selling it, thus depriving the creators of profit. The other three types, however, are much more interesting for a number of reasons.

 1. Trademarks allow the owners to prevent the common usage of certain symbols/words by others. 
 2. Copyright alllows the owner exclusive rights to modify, distribute, display and copy the works.
 3. Patents allow the owner to exclude others from making, selling, or using an inventions in these categories:
      * Utility 
      * Design 
      * Plant [^1]

At their surface, these intellectual property standards seem reasonable, allow for protection against corporate espionage, and for businesses to focus more on production than on guarding trade secrets. Additionally, this prevents others from reverse-engineering a device or flavor, and proceeding to use it as their own; however, the question that needs to be asked, is who are these laws really protecting?

Capitalism, at its core, should be about competing businesses trying to provide the best goods or services for the lowest prices to the consumer. This benefits both the consumer and the producer, as the consumer has more disposable income to spend on many producers, and the producers will make more profit by increasing the scope of their audience. A perfect example of this is Amazon. They cater to 300 million users [^2] and can provide lower cost, and even giveaways of expensive items, to draw more users in. By building out the base of their pyramid, both groups profit. However, there is also a latent exploitative nature to capitalism that needs to be checked by the government, namely in the ability for large corporations to grow ever larger until they either control the market, or until they collapse under their own weight. In the cases of many telecom companies, which provide services instead of goods, it turned out to be the former, and the federal government had to step in to prevent market abuse, specifically in 1982.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * this one
  * that one
  * the other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are
> written like so.
>
> They can span multiple paragraphs,
> if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. â˜º



An h2 header
------------

Here's a numbered list:

 1. first item
 2. second item
 3. third item

Note again how the actual text starts at 4 columns in (4 characters
from the left side). Here's a code sample:

    # Let me re-iterate ...
    for i in 1 .. 10 { do-something(i) }

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~
define foobar() {
    print "Welcome to flavor country!";
}
~~~

(which makes copying & pasting easier). You can optionally mark the
delimited block for Pandoc to syntax highlight it:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
~~~



### An h3 header ###

Now a nested list:

 1. First, get these ingredients:

      * carrots
      * celery
      * lentils

 2. Boil some water.

 3. Dump everything in the pot and follow
    this algorithm:

        find wooden spoon
        uncover pot
        stir
        cover pot
        balance wooden spoon precariously on pot handle
        wait 10 minutes
        goto first step (or shut off burner when done)

    Do not bump wooden spoon or it will fall.

Notice again how text always lines up on 4-space indents (including
that last line which continues item 3 above).

Here's a link to [a website](http://foo.bar), to a [local
doc](local-doc.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#an-h2-header). Here's a footnote .


Tables can look like this:

size  material      color
----  ------------  ------------
9     leather       brown
10    hemp canvas   natural
11    glass         transparent

Table: Shoes, their sizes, and what they're made of

(The above is the caption for the table.) Pandoc also supports
multi-line tables:

--------  -----------------------
keyword   text
--------  -----------------------
red       Sunsets, apples, and
          other red or reddish
          things.

green     Leaves, grass, frogs
          and other things it's
          not easy being.
--------  -----------------------

A horizontal rule follows.

Here's a definition list:

apples
  : Good for making applesauce.
oranges
  : Citrus!
tomatoes
  : There's no "e" in tomatoe.

Again, text is indented 4 spaces. (Put a blank line between each
term/definition pair to spread things out more.)

Here's a "line block":

| Line one
|   Line too
| Line tree

and images can be specified like so:

![example image](example-image.jpg "An exemplary image")

Inline math equations go in like so: $\omega = d\phi / dt$. Display
math should get its own line and be put in in double-dollarsigns:

$I = \int \rho R^{2} dV$

And note that you can backslash-escape any punctuation characters
which you wish to be displayed literally, ex.: \`foo\`, \*bar\*, etc.
