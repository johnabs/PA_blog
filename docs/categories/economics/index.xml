      <description>Intellectual Property: Government Backed Monopolies For All To those of you uninitiated into the world of intellectual property (IP), a quick explanation is in order. In essence, there are three types of IP: trademarks, copywritten works, and patents. Although there is technically a $4^\mathrm{th}$ classification, known as trade secrets, I am not particularly interested in them, as they are simply not revealed to the public. A primary example would be the Coca-Cola formula: it was refined over a long period of time, and it is kept closely guarded as to prevent anyone else from reproducing their product and selling it, thus depriving the creators of profit.</description>
