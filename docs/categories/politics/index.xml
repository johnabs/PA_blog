      <description>Throughout the world, there are many injustices perpetrated by governments on a daily basis, and unfortunately the United States is no exception. While these injustices are prevalent, and essentially a part of the human condition, it is arguably worse when these injustices are in direct contrast to the word of law and the Constitution. Now, it may certainly be my rather naive understanding of our founding principles; however, I do understand that our right to property has come under fire in recent years, especially with civil asset forfeiture, aggressive policing for profit, and the most insidious (at least in my view) property tax and city limitations on property use.</description>
