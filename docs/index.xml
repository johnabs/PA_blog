      <description>In case I didn&amp;rsquo;t mention it on the home-page of my blog, I am currently in the position of transferring out of Science, into a bit more of an engineering role in a tech company. Specifically, I have stopped doing chemistry and have decided to pursue a position regarding data migration. However, as the ever-hungry pursuer of knowledge that I am (or was trained to be), I have decided that learning about the more technical details of computer science will likely benefit both my career and my personal knowledge, especially if I decide to return to academia to get a MS or PhD in this new field.</description>
