<main>
<p>In case I didn&rsquo;t mention it on the home-page of my blog, I am currently in the position of transferring out of Science, into a bit more of an engineering role in a tech company. Specifically, I have stopped doing chemistry and have decided to pursue a position regarding data migration. However, as the ever-hungry pursuer of knowledge that I am (or was trained to be), I have decided that learning about the more technical details of computer science will likely benefit both my career and my personal knowledge, especially if I decide to return to academia to get a MS or PhD in this new field.</p>

<p>The big question, is why would I entertain returning to academia, after all the crap I put up with? Primarily, I think it may be different in computer science due to the nature of the reproducability crisis being almost negligible here. In chemistry, for example, it is very rare that someone would go out of their way to reproduce the results which require multi-million dollar instruments, chemical and/or biological precursors, some of which are taken from humans and cost exorbitant amounts of money. Therefore, if results are discovered (so long as they are plausible) they can get past peer review and be published. This, obviously, leaves much to be desired in terms of accountability and ensuring that the results are correct and reproducible, and that those worthy of being published and receiving grants actually do so. Science, as a rule, is typically not glamorous, and the more we try to shoehorn it into such a position, the lower the quality it will become.</p>

<p>In computer science, however, reproducing results is as easy as hopping on Github and running the code to see if it works for yourself. As someone who is committed to the pursuit of knowledge and improving society, I want to be competing on an even playing field which prevents unscrupulous people from getting ahead from their name, preexisting credentials, or unproven results alone. I want accountability, and the current peer review system allows a lot to seep through the cracks. But how on earth am I ever going to get into CS while working a job, and paying bills, eventually having children, etc?</p>

<p>Enter the open source CS degree. It&rsquo;s a compiled list of completely free, online courses provided by top schools around the country. I&rsquo;ll link it here <a href="https://github.com/mvillaloboz/open-source-cs-degree">https://github.com/mvillaloboz/open-source-cs-degree</a>, for those of you who are interested. My plan is to work through these courses at my own pace, in the time I&rsquo;m not actively working on work, so I can broaden my coding knowledge base, learn more about the fundamentals of computers, and ideally figure out how to write clean, concise, highly functional, extensible, and fast code. The Unix philosophy, in my opinion, reigns supreme on this matter, and I&rsquo;m planning to apply what I learn along those lines.</p>

<p>As I work through it, I&rsquo;ve considered starting a Youtube channel to track my progress, as well as include my own notes on the matter for others looking to learn. Either that, or I&rsquo;ll leave a CliffNotes-esque summary here for each course I complete. For any of you thinking of following a similar path, I hope my experience can be useful, and perhaps can teach you something about how to learn on your own with the vast amount of resources we have available to us in the age of the internet, and can encourage you to follow whatever passions you may have.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
