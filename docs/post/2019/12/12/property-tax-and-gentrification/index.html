<p>Throughout the world, there are many injustices perpetrated by governments on a daily basis, and unfortunately the United States is no exception. While these injustices are prevalent, and essentially a part of the human condition, it is arguably worse when these injustices are in direct contrast to the word of law and the Constitution. Now, it may certainly be my rather naive understanding of our founding principles; however, I do understand that our right to property has come under fire in recent years, especially with civil asset forfeiture, aggressive policing for profit, and the most insidious (at least in my view) property tax and city limitations on property use. These are the most fundamental to our rights, to be property owning citizens, and this behavior actively harms us and leads to gentrification across the nation.</p>
<p>Let's consider the following situation: a struggling home-owner, but a home-owner nonetheless, happens to reside in some west coast town of Fran Sancisco (original, I know). Recently, many tech companies started moving to the area as Silicon Valley has become increasingly overpopulated. As these tech positions spread, the property values go up, and Fran Sancisco is artificially restricting the ability of rental property owners from expanding and producing more housing to keep up with the increased demand. This imbalance of supply and demand drives property prices to astronomical levels and creates an artificial boom, which is great for the governmental officials (increased tax revenue), and the wealthier residents who can ride the wave and possibly make some money during this process. However, for our struggling home-owner, her property tax just increased to 30,000/year, and her 600 sqft house is now valued at 1.5 million. She can't afford the payments, the city shows up and forcibly evicts her, as they have had a lien on her home. Best case scenario? She gets to sell the house, before this becomes an issue pocket some fraction of the maximum value of the house (taxes, and inability to ride the wave), and possibly move elsewhere with her newfound wealth. But she can't stay. She's stuck with a lump sum payment, and now has to relocate which means she likely just lost her job as well. Overall a great short term gain, but a likely long term disaster.</p>
<p>Let's look at this from a different &ldquo;timeline&rdquo; if you will. In this timeline, property taxes don't exist, and neither do extensive restrictions on expanding on your property into new housing. Here, we see a different story for our struggling home-owner, as well as the local rental agencies. Primarily, during growth the rental agencies can expand and provide more supply to keep up with demand, thus stabilizing prices to a degree. Additionally, their costs do not increase along with this boom, thus allowing them to continue to rent to lower-income individuals at their discretion, especially considering a long-term lease agreement or good renters, without displacing their customers. Our home-owner's costs do not increase, aside from perhaps on the cost of local goods, but in this scenario she gets to keep a majority of the wealth generated from the growth in her area, and can take steps to increase her income, such as refinancing her home once it reaches a certain value she's comfortable with, thus increasing her ability to stay afloat, and possibly improve her position more. Of course, we would have to deal with the issue of wealthy individuals purchasing property across the country and possibly hoarding it; however, this could possibly be solved with a cap, or a maximum rate of property purchasing per year, implemented federally. This also provides benefits to other groups, such as families burdened by selling a relatives home when they pass away, or being unable to continue to make payments on a family farm due to the land, which leads farmers further into loans and debt.</p>
<p>As much as I have libertarian tendencies, I am not so utopian to think that people would not attempt to exploit this newfound freedom, and I fully understand that governments need to fund themselves to provide the necessary services such as the police force, fire departments, etc.  With that being said, our guaranteed right to property needs to have the utmost protection if we are to call ourselves free, and there are alternative taxation systems that allow us to achieve the same outcome, but without violating our fundamental principles. We should be able to own property without being in a permanent leasing agreement with the government, because in that scenario a lapsed payment leads to swift and permanent eviction, which proves who the owner truly is. This immoral tax must be removed, and in doing so, our tax system becomes a bit simpler, our rights are bolstered, struggling families have more breathing room. With a relaxation of restrictive property laws, property managers can increase their offerings to the public when growth occurs, without being forced to cover ever-increasing costs due to both the constant rise of inflation and the ballooning value of property in these areas. It is my hope that we come to our senses and demand the market to be more free, and us along with it.</p>
