      <description>Collegiate education has become a controversial topic in US politics, and as one who attended higher education for 8 years, attempted a PhD in STEM, and has taught many students with varying levels of enthusiasm, I can certainly understand why. At its best, a college education should hypothetically produce well-rounded, capable individuals with a specialization in a particular (or many) fields. This should ideally increase the student&amp;rsquo;s ability to find employment, as they should be distinguished from their peers, and allows employers to quickly discriminate amongst potential candidates by using the degree they&amp;rsquo;ve achieved as a useful heuristic.</description>
