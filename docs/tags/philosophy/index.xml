      <description>Polarization: division into two sharply distinct opposites.
Privacy: the state of being free from public attention or unsanctioned intrusion.
Attention: the ability or power to keep the mind on something.
These are the primary reasons I&amp;rsquo;m leaving the more traditional social media sites. In this article, I&amp;rsquo;ll be making the case for why these traditional sites move us in a direction away from the optimal positions in these three important areas of modern living, and I&amp;rsquo;ll be linking alternative tools below that supplement or replace these original websites more effectively.</description>

      <description>Those who know me know I am a huge fan of GNU/Linux (for you Stallman), and I originally got into it to help me with a few chemistry simulations in my quantum mechanics and statistical dynamics course in undergrad. Specifically, my professor made a huge deal about turning in lab reports that were formatted ever-so precisely, and to kill two birds with one stone, I installed Linux on my computer to help me learn and interface with the supercomputer, and installed LaTeX to help with the lab report issue.</description>
