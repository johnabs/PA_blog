      <description>The beginning of this post is going to sound ridiculous, but I promise it is 100% true. One night went to bed trying to remember the name of an interesting programming language that I heard about a while back. It supposedly had a lot of super nifty features, and was some strange hybrid of multiple languages that still somehow worked. I was intrigued, but couldn&#39;t remember, so I decided to just go to sleep and figure it out in the morning.</description>

      <description>Those who know me know I am a huge fan of GNU/Linux (for you Stallman), and I originally got into it to help me with a few chemistry simulations in my quantum mechanics and statistical dynamics course in undergrad. Specifically, my professor made a huge deal about turning in lab reports that were formatted ever-so precisely, and to kill two birds with one stone, I installed Linux on my computer to help me learn and interface with the supercomputer, and installed LaTeX to help with the lab report issue.</description>
